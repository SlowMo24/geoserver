.. note:: GeoMesa support is not enabled by default and requires the GeoMesa extension to be installed prior to use.  Please see `Installing the GeoMesa GeoServer plugins <http://www.geomesa.org/documentation/user/installation_and_configuration.html#installing-the-geomesa-geoserver-plugins>`_ in the GeoMesa documentation for information on installing this. 
the section on :ref:`arcsde_install` for details.

GeoMesa is an open-source solution maintained and supported by CCRi for storing, indexing, querying, transforming, and visualizing spatio-temporal data at scale in Accumulo, HBase, and Cassandra. 

GeoMesa has plugins for GeoServer to expose spatial data as WMS or WFS services directly from Accumulo. This facilitates out-of-the-box integration with a wide variety of existing OGC compliant clients.
